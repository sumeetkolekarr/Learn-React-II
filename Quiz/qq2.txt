1. What do props help us accomplish?
    Make a component more reusable

2. How do you pass a prop into a component?
    <MyAweSomeComponent  title="" name="" anything=""/>

3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. whatever={true}) to a native DOM element? (e.g. <div whatever=true>) Why or why not?
    No, Because the JSX we use to describe native DOM elements will be turned into REAL DOM elements by React. And the real DOM elements only have the properties/attributes specified in the HTML specs(which doesn't include properties like `whatever`)

4. How do I receive props in component?
    function Nav(props){
        console.log(props.whatever)
        return (
            <header>
                ...
            </header>
        )
    }

5. What data type is `props` when the component recieves it?
    An Object!
